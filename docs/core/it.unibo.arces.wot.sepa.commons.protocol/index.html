            <p>The Class SSLSecurityManager. * ### Key and Certificate Storage ### The Java platform provides for
                long-term persistent storage of cryptographic keys and certificates via key and certificate stores.
                Specifically, the java.security.KeyStore class represents a key store, a secure repository of
                cryptographic keys and/or trusted certificates (to be used, for example, during certification path
                validation), and the java.security.cert.CertStore class represents a certificate store, a public and
                potentially vast repository of unrelated and typically untrusted certificates. A CertStore may also
                store CRLs. KeyStore and CertStore implementations are distinguished by types. The Java platform
                includes the standard PKCS11 and PKCS12 key store types (whose implementations are compliant with the
                corresponding PKCS specifications from RSA Security). It also contains a proprietary file-based key
                store type called JKS (which stands for "Java Key Store"), and a type called DKS ("Domain Key Store")
                which is a collection of keystores that are presented as a single logical keystore. ### PKI Tools ###
                There are two built-in tools for working with keys, certificates, and key stores: keytool is used to
                create and manage key stores. It can - Create public/private key pairs - Display, import, and export
                X.509 v1, v2, and v3 certificates stored as files - Create self-signed certificates ### Secure
                Communication ### The data that travels across a network can be accessed by someone who is not the
                intended recipient. When the data includes private information, such as passwords and credit card
                numbers, steps must be taken to make the data unintelligible to unauthorized parties. It is also
                important to ensure that you are sending the data to the appropriate party, and that the data has not
                been modified, either intentionally or unintentionally, during transport. Cryptography forms the basis
                required for secure communication, and that is described in Section 4. The Java platform also provides
                API support and provider implementations for a number of standard secure communication protocols. ###
                SSL/TLS ### The Java platform provides APIs and an implementation of the SSL and TLS protocols that
                includes functionality for data encryption, message integrity, server authentication, and optional
                client authentication. Applications can use SSL/TLS to provide for the secure passage of data between
                two peers over any application protocol, such as HTTP on top of TCP/IP. The javax.net.ssl.SSLSocket
                class represents a network socket that encapsulates SSL/TLS support on top of a normal stream socket
                (java.net.Socket). Some applications might want to use alternate data transport abstractions (e.g.,
                New-I/O); the javax.net.ssl.SSLEngine class is available to produce and consume SSL/TLS packets. The
                Java platform also includes APIs that support the notion of pluggable (provider-based) key managers and
                trust managers. A key manager is encapsulated by the javax.net.ssl.KeyManager class, and manages the
                keys used to perform authentication. A trust manager is encapsulated by the TrustManager class (in the
                same package), and makes decisions about who to trust based on certificates in the key store it manages.
                The Java platform includes a built-in provider that implements the SSL/TLS protocols: SSLv3 TLSv1
                TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2</p>
